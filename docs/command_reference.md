### qliksense preflight

Preflight checks provide pre-installation cluster conformance testing and validation before we install qliksense on the cluster. We gather a suite of conformance tests that can be easily written and run on the target cluster to verify that cluster-specific requirements are met.

We support the following tests at the moment as part of preflight checks, and the range of the suite will be expanded in future.

Run the following command to view help about the commands supported by preflight at any moment:
```
qliksense preflight
```

#### Running all checks
Run the following command to execute all preflight checks
```
qliksense preflight all --mongodb-url=<mongo-server url> --mongodb-ca-cert=<path to ca-cert file>
```

#### Running specific check
Run the following command to execute a specific check
```
qliksense preflight dns
```

### qliksense load

`qliksense load` command takes input from a file or from pipe

- `qliksense load -f cr-file.yaml`
- `cat cr-file.yaml | qliksense load -f -`

This will load the Custom Resource (CR) into `${QLIKSENSE_HOME}` folder, create context structure and set the current context to that CR.

This will also encrypt the secrets from CR while writing the CR into the disk.

### qliksense apply

`qliksense apply` command takes input from a file or from pipe

- `qliksense apply -f cr-file.yaml`
- `cat cr-file.yaml | qliksense apply -f -`

The content of `cr-file.yaml` should be something like the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: qlik.com/v1
kind: Qliksense
metadata:
  name: qlik-test
  labels:
    version: v0.0.2
spec:
  configs:
    qliksense:
    - name: acceptEULA
      value: "yes"
  secrets:
    qliksense:
    - name: mongoDbUri
      value: mongodb://qlik-test-mongodb:27017/qliksense?ssl=false
  profile: docker-desktop
  rotateKeys: "yes"
```

`qliksense apply` does everything `qliksense load` does but will install Qlik Sense into the cluster as well

### qliksense about

`qliksense about` command will display information about [qliksense-k8s](https://github.com/qlik-oss/qliksense-k8s) release.

For example, running the following command will show information about default profile for `1.0.0` tag

```
qliksense about 1.0.0
```

Run the following command to view options for `about` command:
```
qliksense about --help
```

Using other supported commands user might have built the CR into the location `~/.qliksense/myqliksense.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: qlik.com/v1
kind: QlikSense
metadata:
  name: myqliksense
spec:
  profile: docker-desktop
  manifestsRoot: /Usr/xyz/my-k8-repo/manifests
  namespace: myqliksense
  storageClassName: efs
  configs:
    qliksense:
    - name: acceptEULA
      value: "yes"
  secrets:
    qliksense:
    - name: mongoDbUri
      value: "mongo://mongo:3307"
    - name: messagingPassword
      valueFromKey: messagingPassword
```

In this case, the result of `qliksense about` command would display information from:

- `/Usr/xyz/my-k8-repo/manifests/docker-desktop` location, or
- Pull and show information from `master` branch if the directory is invalid or empty


### qliksense config

`qliksense config` will perform operations on configurations and contexts regarding the [qliksense-k8](https://github.com/qlik-oss/qliksense-k8s) release.

It supports the following flags:

- `qliksense config apply` - generate the patches and apply manifests to K8s
- `qliksense config list-contexts` - get and list contexts
- `qliksense config set` - configure a key-value pair into the current context
- `qliksense config set-configs` - set configurations into qliksense context as key-value pairs
- `qliksense config set-context` - sets the Kubernetes context where resources are located
- `qliksense config set-secrets <service_name>.<attribute>="<value>" --secret=false` - set secrets configurations into qliksense context as key-value pairs and show encrypted value as part of CR
- `qliksense config set-secrets <service_name>.<attribute>="<value>" --secret=true` - set secrets configurations into qliksense context as key-value pairs and show a key reference to the created Kubernetes secret resource as part of the CR
- `qliksense config view` - view the qliksense operator CR
- `qliksense config delete-context` - deletes a specific context locally (not in-cluster). Deletes context in spec of `config.yaml` and locally deletes entire folder of specified context (does not delete secrets from cluster)


The global file which abstracts all contexts is `~/.qliksense/config.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: config.qlik.com/v1
kind: QliksenseConfig
metadata:
  name: QliksenseConfigMetadata
spec:
  contexts:
  - name: qlik-default
    crFile: /Users/xyz/.qliksense/contexts/qlik-default/qlik-default.yaml
  - name: myqliksense
    crFile: /Users/xyz/.qliksense/contexts/myqliksense/myqliksense.yaml
  - name: hello
    crFile: /Users/xyz/.qliksense/contexts/hello/hello.yaml
  currentContext: hello
```
